## Format 
We will have informal discussion of recent system security papers. The organizer will choose the paper, but we can decide on the next paper at the meeting.
You can also your discussion topics, or simply ask questions.

It is best that every participant should read the paper beforehand and try to bring some discussions / questions to the meeting. 

The discussion topics could be, but not limited to:
- Comparison with previous approach & novelty
- Limitations & future work
- Specific techniques used in the paper

<!-- I think the most simple way to bring discussions is to try to answer a question about the paper and convince everyone about your answer.  -->
<!-- For example, some questions might be: -->
<!-- - What are the problem addressed by the papers? What did the paper (and other papers) say about the challenges?  -->
<!-- - What were the previous approaches, and how did the proposed methods improves over the previous approaches? -->
<!-- - Is there still open challenges? -->
<!-- - Does the proposed approach requires any assumptions? Are they reasonable? -->
<!-- - What could be done differently if you were to solve the same challenges? -->
