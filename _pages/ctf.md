Hands-on experience is one of the most important things in learning, especially in cyber security.
With that in mind, we developed this [Capture The Flag (CTF) platform](https://ctf.skku.edu) to aid with the teaching of our courses.

The SSLab-CTF platform is built upon the open-source [CTFd](https://ctfd.io/) platform with modifications to make it suitable for education envirionment.
